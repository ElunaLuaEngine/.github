## About

**Eluna Lua Engine Â©** is a Lua interpreter embedded into World of Warcraft emulators, enabling you to script content through Lua.

We provide a [**TrinityCore fork**](https://github.com/ElunaLuaEngine/ElunaTrinityWotlk) with Eluna pre-implemented, and it is also available through community-maintained third-party emulators listed below.

Our goal is to make Eluna an **efficient, performant, and seamless scripting experience** through a unified API across emulators.  

If you are having trouble with installation or scripts, please don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/ElunaLuaEngine/Eluna/issues) or reach out via our community Discord.
